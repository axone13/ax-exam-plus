### What is Exam Plus?
Exam Plus is a tool for students to solve exams together. First, students submit their answers for exams. Then, the program calculates the best answer for each question based on the student's answers.

#### how to install :
1. First, you need to copy the `system` and `application` folders into a PHP hosting.
2. Configure CodeIgniter and database through 'application/config/'.
3. Create a database and import `database.sql` to it (don't forget to configure `application/config/database.php`).
4. Add admin's password to `application/controllers/Admin.php` (admin is going to need this for managing users and exams).
5. Create a Username and Password for your users and give it to them.
6. Create Exams
7. Enjoy :)

##### how to manage users and exams?
users and exams can be managed through domain.com/index.php/admin.\
the password for admin is the one that you have entered in step 4 when installing. (default: 123456789)
